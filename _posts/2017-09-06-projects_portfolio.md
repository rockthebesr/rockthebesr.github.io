### Phocas Food Restaurant
A fast food chain using dummy data. The project has two user classes that include employees and customers.

A customer can create an online order for himself/herself by providing the necessary information.

An employee can login using his/her name and employee ID. An employee can then modify our database by adding any of the following: order, item, store, menu or item. An employee can also delete a menu, delete an employee or modify the status of an order at any time. In addition an employee can search the database for any of the following: instances of any of the entities in our database, list the employee IDs working at a store, find a store that has all the menus, sales of each store, sales of each province, find the most expensive item and find the least expensive item.
